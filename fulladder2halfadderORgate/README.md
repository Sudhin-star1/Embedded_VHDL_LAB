## Full Adder VHDL Implementation

A VHDL implementation of a full adder circuit, composed of half adders and an OR gate, along with a testbench to verify its functionality.

Introduction
This project provides VHDL code for a full adder circuit, which is a fundamental component in digital logic design. The full adder is implemented using two half adders and an OR gate. Additionally, a testbench is included to simulate and verify the functionality of the full adder.

Implements a full adder circuit in VHDL.
Includes a testbench for functional verification.
Modular design using half adders and an OR gate.
Clear and concise code structure for easy understanding and modification.
