In VHDL, architecture can be described in three main styles: 

1 behavioral
2 structural
3 dataflow

Each style focuses on different aspects of the design process and is used for different purposes.

1. Behavioral Style Architecture: This style describes the behavior or functionality of the system in an algorithmic manner. It model how the circuit outputs will behave to the circuits inputs.This model may not refleecy how the circuit is implemented when it is synthesized.in this style the internal working is implemented using sequential statements within process statements.

Pros: Quick to implement, easier to understand algorithmic behavior, suitable for high-level modeling.
Cons: May not reflect hardware structure accurately, lower reusability due to specific algorithms.

Example of behavioral style architecture:

library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
ENTITY HALF_ADDER IS
PORT (
    A, B : IN STD_LOGIC;
    SUM, CARRY : OUT STD_LOGIC
);
END ENTITY HALF_ADDER;

ARCHITECTURE BEHAVIORAL OF HALF_ADDER IS
BEGIN
    PROCESS (A, B)
    BEGIN
        SUM <= A XOR B;
        CARRY <= A AND B;
    END PROCESS;
END ARCHITECTURE BEHAVIORAL;

2. Structural Style Architecture: This style describes the system as a collection of interconnected components.It is most useful when designing complex systems by breaking them down into simpler, reusable components.Each component is a placeholder for a design entity and represents a physical piece of hardware, such as a logic gate or a flip-flop.The architecture body in structural style consists of component instantiation statements, which specify how these components are interconnected.

Pros: Offers better control over hardware structure, facilitates component reuse, suitable for complex designs.
Cons: Requires more effort for interconnections, may be more complex to understand initially.

Example of structural style architecture:

library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

ENTITY TEST IS
PORT (
    A, B, C, D : IN STD_LOGIC;
    Z : OUT STD_LOGIC
);
END ENTITY TEST;

ARCHITECTURE TEST_ARCH OF TEST IS

COMPONENT AND_GATE
PORT (
    X, Y : IN STD_LOGIC;
    when : OUT STD_LOGIC
);
END COMPONENT;

COMPONENT OR_GATE
PORT (
    X, Y : IN STD_LOGIC;
    when : OUT STD_LOGIC
);
END COMPONENT;

SIGNAL E,F: STD_LOGIC;

BEGIN
    U1: AND_GATE PORT MAP (X=>A, Y=>B, W=>E);
    U2: AND_GATE PORT MAP (X=>C, Y=>D, W=>F);
    U3: OR_GATE PORT MAP (X=>E, Y=>F, W=>Z);
END ARCHITECTURE TEST_ARCH;
